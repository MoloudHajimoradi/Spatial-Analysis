# Spatial-Analysis

## Real Estate Investment Analysis
Use multivariate kernel density estimation to estimate the probability of spatially distributed phenomena

Suppose that in the "KDE_data", each row represents a car break-in in Toronto. You own a real-estate company in Toronto and your client asked you to identify areas with high potential for investment and your client identified that areas with higher than average car break-ins tend to be less profitable. Help your client identify regions of Toronto where they should invest.
